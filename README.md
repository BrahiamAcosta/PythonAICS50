# CS50 AI with Python Projects

This is a repository for projects and exercises from the [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) course offered by Harvard University through edX.

## About the Course

CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern AI. This course covers a range of topics including:

- Search algorithms
- Knowledge representation
- Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning
- Machine learning
- Neural networks
- Natural language processing

The course is designed to provide both theoretical understanding and practical experience through a series of hands-on projects.

## Projects and Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the projects and exercises from the course. Below is a brief overview of the projects I have completed so far:

1. **Degrees of Separation**: Implementing a search algorithm to find the shortest path between actors in a movie database.
2. **Tic Tac Toe**: Developing an AI that plays Tic Tac Toe using the Minimax algorithm.
3. **Knights and knaves**: Completed the logical puzzles by adding the logical propositions to solve each one of the proposed puzzles

More projects will be added as I complete them.
